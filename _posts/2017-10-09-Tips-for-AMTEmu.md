### Alghorithm

The simplified alghorithm for the Adobe protection mechanism of the emulator is included in the archive as well. For those who want to understand the idea in general: everything is required for emulator is the amtlib.dll chain, everything else is not important.

The simplified alghorithm of Adobe's amtlib:

Many users still ask me what is the difference between AMTEmu & Universal Patcher. Let's make it clear.

It is obvious what is the patch is.  
Any patch modifies the target application and its logic. As of amtlib, it makes possible to bypass the activation of  "features".
AMTEmu is the result of my researh which I personally use and decided to share it with you. After I learned how Adobe's protection works, I made a conclusion that the patch\keygen method has issues for me and it is not perfect. So, AMTEmu fixes those issues and emulates processes related to Adobe Application Manager without any reference to Adobe Application Manager.
 
For the average user there is no difference what exactly to use, since the result will be the same: Adobe apps will work.
 
There are several reasons to use AMTEmu:

1. You need to create a portable version of apps without the protection to use it on any supported hadrware.  
2. You have no sufficient rights to install Adobe software with its protection, which will not work under the limited user account.
3. You would like to save some disk space by disabling software protection logs.
4. You are not happy to send any data to Adobe servers which will be collected and sent by services installed on the PC.  

and so on.
 
In any other case, you can use any patch of keygen you have. 

## Usage

### For Mac users!

I had no time to implement the elevation request. That's why you need to use sudo when you have no sufficient privileges to modify the apps folder. Otherwise you will need to create configs and copy emulator's files manually.

````bash
Last login: Mon Oct xx xx:xx:xx on console
User:~ user$  
sudo /AMTEmu.app/Contents/MacOS/AMTEmu 
````

### Tips

**Attention: Galaxy used those Adobe software below just for testing purpose. Never for productive artworks.**

The most important thing is to set currect `LEID` in `painter.ini` at `.app/Contents/Frameworks/amtlib.framework/Versions/A/`.

Galaxy was using the *0.8.1* GUI which set the `LEID` of *Adobe Acrobat DC* to `V7{}AcrobatCont-12-Mac-GM` for my *DC Classic Track*. This make my Acrobat always hang for a non-Continuous-Track licence.
After reading for the offical [Licensing identifiers page](https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/AdminGuide/identify.html), Galaxy find `V7{}AcrobatESR-17-Mac-GM` can make my *DC Classic Track 2017* running.

More details can be find on [that page](https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/AdminGuide/identify.html), the difference between two Acrobat DC tracks can be find at offical [Document Cloud Product Tracks](http://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/acrobatetk/tools/AdminGuide/whatsnewdc.html#continuous-vs-classic-comparison) page.

The Acrobat DC product family introduces two tracks for both Acrobat which are essentially different products:

* The Continuous track provides service-based tools as well as new features, security and platform enhancements, and bug fixes as part of frequent (and most often) silent updates. Over time, the Continuous track’s update cadence will be more frequent than the Classic track. Classic license program customers do not have access to this track for Acrobat.
* The Classic track is similar to the 10.x-11.x model and provide few (if any) new features in updates. Free services are available, but optional. Like previous releases, a quarterly update cadence delivers security and platform enhancements as well as bug fixes.

For up-to-date details about what features exist in each track, see offical [
New features summary | Acrobat DC](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/whats-new.html).

DC Versioning

Track release schedules and their respective versions will be different, but both the Continuous and Classic tracks share an identical methodology. The new strategy is designed to provide better granularity, support more frequent releases, and aid in troubleshooting by providing build information. In it’s generic form, the version number will appear as `major.minor.minor_minor`.

|Version |Range |Notes|
|---|---|---|
|major |1-255 |The last two digits of the release year.*|
|minor |1-255 |An internal number indicating when code moves from Trunk to Beta.|
|minor_minor |1-65535 |The first two digits indicate the track. 20 = Continuous. 30 = Classic.|
|Hidden 4th field |Changelist number |Only visible if user **clicks on the version number in the About box**.|

\* The year-based version number is not the same as the Classic track name. While the Classic track versions begins with `15` or `17` and the current track version is `2015|2017`, the track name only changes at each major release–not every year. The version number increments every year.

Simply Speaking, next time reinstall system, try the Continuous track of [Acrobat for Macintosh](http://supportdownloads.adobe.com/product.jsp?product=1&platform=Macintosh).

额，Galaxy当年是觉得`AcrobatCont`的按用户授权模式比`AcrobatESR`的按序列号授权要麻烦，所以优先测试 *Classic track 2015*。后来也没机会测其他的，毕竟苹果下用 *Preview* 看 PDF 挺方便的。

#### Licensing identifiers (LeID)

Licensing identifiers (LEID) provide a unique way to identify most of Adobe’s licensed products.

DC Continuous Track

    Win - V7{}AcrobatCont-12-Win-GM
    Mac - V7{}AcrobatCont-12-Mac-GM

DC Classic Track 2017

    Win – V7{}AcrobatESR-17-Win-GM
    Mac – V7{}AcrobatESR-17-Mac-GM

DC Classic Track 2015

    Win – V7{}AcrobatESR-12-Win-GM
    Mac – V7{}AcrobatESR-12-Mac-GM

    Note:
    Once an ETLA serial is provided, the LEID changes for unserialized commands. 
	For both tracks It becomes V7{}AcrobatETLA-12-Win-GM (on Windows) and V7{}AcrobatETLA-12-Mac-GM (on Macintosh).
